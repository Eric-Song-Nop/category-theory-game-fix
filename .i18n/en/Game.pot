"A category `C` consists of\n"
"  * a collection of objects `X, Y, Z, ...`\n"
"  * a collection of morphisms `f, g, h, ...`\n"
"so that:\n"
"  * each morphism has specified domain and codomain objects;\n"
"    `f : X ⟶ Y` signifies that `f` is a morphism with\n"
"    domain `X` and codomain `Y`\n"
"  * each object has a designated identity morphism `𝟙 X : X ⟶ X`\n"
"  * for any pair of morphisms `f, g` with the codomain of `f` equal\n"
"    to the domain of `g`,the exists a specified composite morphism\n"
"    `f ≫ g` whose domain is that of `f` and codomain that of `g`,\n"
"    i.e. `f : X ⟶ Y, g : Y ⟶ Z` then `f ≫ g : X ⟶ Z`\n"
